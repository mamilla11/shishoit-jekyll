<p>
  Our in-house projects are concentrated around IoT sensing systems. We have designed, 
  constructed and programmed several different weather stations. One of them is up on the roof 
  of our house and it is called the Swallow, the second one is hanging outside the window and 
  it is called the Bee. Both of them are ambient sensor platforms.
</p>

<p>
  The Swallow is our first connected amateur weather station. It consists of a bunch of different 
  sensors to measure temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, light and even ionizing radiation.
</p>

<p>
  The Bee is a universal platform for designing IoT wireless sensor networks. It consists of two devices:
  a data acquisition autonomous wireless sensor node without external power supply and a receiver board
  for interacting with sensor nodes and PC or gateway connection.
</p>

<p>
  Each weather station is connected to the server in order to collect data and visualize it.
